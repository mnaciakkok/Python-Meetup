    "Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.\n",

    "Python is a bit like Matlab or R. You will often hear that Python with NumPy/SciPy (numerical/scientific math libraries) and matplotlib (plotting library) is the equivalent of Matlab. Python is used a good deal in natural sciences (especially biology/bio-informatics), in data sciences (for statistics, AI and machine learning), and fun areas like designing intelligence in games or in designing game-playing AI software (soft-bots).
